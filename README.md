# Recipetree

An automatic tree delineation and forest analysis package. This package consists of 4 modules, each with a distinct purpose:

- **Analysis**: With this module, you can estimate tree parameters in a forest area and gain insights from it.
- **Delineation**: Need assistance to delineate individual tree crowns in the input area, use this module. Although the performance isn't perfect, it's still better than manually delineate everything by yourself.
- **Cleaning**: If you area is a mixed forest with non-tree low vegetation and or open deforested area, combine this module with delineation module to get the best results.
- **Evaluations**: You are a geek and would like to assess the delineation performance or compare it with another delineation results? This module is for you
